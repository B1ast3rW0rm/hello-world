Hello: My name is Joe.

I'm currently in position to get my initial 802 exams, although as a kid I always knew I would end up in the IT profession. It's a hobby as well as future oppertunities of endless possibilites. I love problem solving and learning new things. My dream is to become a NetSec specialist, the road seems long but slow and steady win the race. I study computers on my own, and dedicate time each day to learn and build my knowledge, as well as study for my exams. Im glad to be part of this community and in the future to come, from the experiances and knowledge I gain, hope to add to the GNU collective, as well to learn from the vets. Namaste.
